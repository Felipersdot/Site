				<p id="skills">UML diagrams were used to solidify associations between classes, interfaces, and proper data structures within classes, to ensure cohesive operations between instances of multiple classes. Design patterns such as Façade, Decorator, and Observer were used between the development of the classes. Allowing instances of classes to be responsive based on the appropriate events that were taking place by their respective instances. This was ensured by using core java concepts related to Object Oriented Programming: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data abstraction. Finally, examining code by testing for exceptions and refactoring master code to its GUI using the java Swing Library. Finalizing all documentation on the API and releasing sets for general users and developers respectively.</p>
